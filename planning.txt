In general it seems best to have a "State" that manages what can be done in the app
    via the current user "Mode"

Modes:
    Drag: dragging the canvas to different locations
    
get the drawings rendering as Meshes so that its efficient
get an eraser in there
get the camera in there
set it up for wasm


Notes / Bugs:
- when not in full screen its 60fps rather than 120
