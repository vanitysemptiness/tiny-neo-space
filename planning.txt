In general it seems best to have a "State" that manages what can be done in the app
    via the current user "Mode"

Modes:
    Drag: dragging the canvas to different locations
    
get the drawings rendering as Meshes so that its efficient
get an eraser in there
get the camera in there
set it up for wasm


Notes / Bugs:
- when not in full screen its 60fps rather than 120
- grab currently doesn't mean anything because the canvas is not infinite
- you can draw over the buttons

What to do Next:
- when you click there should be a dot
- switch the drawing to mesh based rendering for efficientcy
- set this porject up for webassembly
- separate the lines on the mesh into objects (one continuous stroke. What about if seperated)
- make a spot eraser and an object eraser
- add back in the dots and the zooming
- 

The Paper Effect:
the texture goes on after the drawing and is likely a shader
    that can go ontop of whatever
